# TODO: Fix Undefined Variable $slot Error

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create the `app-layout` Blade component by copying content from `layouts/app.blade.php` to `resources/views/components/app-layout.blade.php`
- [x] Update the component to use @yield('content') instead of {{ $slot }} for compatibility with @extends views
- [x] Change dashboard.blade.php to use @extends('layouts.app') instead of <x-app-layout> to match other views
- [ ] Test the dashboard page and other views to ensure the error is resolved
